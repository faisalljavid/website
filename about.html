		<p>James Philip Nelson was born in 1967 in Sevenoaks, Kent. He spent his childhood in Africa, Asia and South America, traveling around with his father, who worked as a geologist for International Shell. At the age of 7, he was sent to Stonyhurst College, a Jesuit boarding school in Lancashire, UK. When he was 16, he developed Alopecia totalis, a condition in which all the hair falls out, which was caused by a culmination of stress and a reaction to malaria medication.
			In 2010, Nelson started to work on his second book, Before they Pass Away. He travelled for 3 years and photographed more than 35 indigenous tribes around the world in Europe, Asia, Africa, South America, and the South Pacific, using a 50-year-old 4x5in camera. Nelson said the project was "inspired by Edward S. Curtis and his great photographs of Native Americans". Like Curtis, Nelson documents his subjects in a romantic, stylised and posed manner, with the aim of "putting them on a pedestal". 
			Nelson remarks that the project is not meant to convey "a documentary truth, but rather own artistic interpretation and a celebration of diversity and beauty." The tribes that Nelson photographed include the Huli and Kalam tribes of New Guinea, the Tsaatan of Mongolia and the Mursi people of the Omo River valley in southern Ethiopia. 
			In a TED talk he described the working process used in this project and stated it occasionally took "months trying to find [these indigenous peoples] and then again weeks to gain their trust and permission to photograph. Nelson borrowed the funds for the project from a Dutch billionaire, Marcel Boekhoorn. As a result of the project, a book containing the photographs and texts, a limited edition of the book, as well as printed photo portraits were published.</p>
